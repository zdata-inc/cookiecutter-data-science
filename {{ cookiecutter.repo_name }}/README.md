{{cookiecutter.description}}

Initial steps for the person who cookiecutter cloned this repo:
- [ ] Once: Initialize git repo with `git init`.
- [ ] Optional, once: Initialize DVC with `dvc init`.
- [ ] Optional, once: Set up a [dvc remote](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/remote).
- [ ] Go through and delete files we don't want.

Everyone who clones this repo:
- Set up a python virtual environment and automate its use when in this directory, using your preferred method. E.g., with pyenv-virtualenv: ``pyenv virtualenv {{ cookiecutter.min_python_version }} {{ cookiecutter.repo_name }} `` then `echo {{ cookiecutter.repo_name }} > .python-version`
- `pip install -e '.[dev]'` to install our project in editable mode with dev
  dependencies.
- `pip install pre-commit`.
- Set up pre-commit hooks `pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push --hook-type post-checkout --hook-type pre-commit`
- If using DVC: Set up [DVC merge driver](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/how-to/resolve-merge-conflicts#directories)
- If using DVC, set up DVC pre-commit hooks: `dvc install --use-pre-commit-tool`
- `nox`: Use this to run tests when you're refactoring or whatever. It's
  not linked to a pre-commit hook like the linting/DVC is as it's a bit slower,
  so use your own judgement about when to run it. Github workflows will also
  run it when we push to Github.
